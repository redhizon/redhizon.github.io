         Since I have three names, people call me differently. Some call me
         "Rafael" while others prefer "Angelo". However, most people
        especially my professors and classmates in the university... they love to call me <strong>Red</strong>,
        and that became my official college nickname ever since!

            I am currently a sophomore student in the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. I am taking
          <strong>BS Computer Science</strong> because I really love to learn how to program in order to
          create beautiful apps and websites. In fact, this page is actually our laboratory exercise
          on our <a href="http://ics.uplb.edu.ph/courses/ugrad/cmsc/100" target="_blank">web programming course!</a>
          It's sad that we can't go back to our campus yet due to the pandemic. The picture here is the last photo that I took before the pandemic.

            As a <em>komsay iskolar</em>, I have encountered a lot of punishing subjects that really
            forced my mind to think critically. But even though the courses were hard, I truly appreciate them
            for they have played a significant role in my development stage as a programmer.
             So far, my favorite computer science
            course is <strong>CMSC 100 - Web Programming</strong> because I am in love with the idea of bringing
            imagination to life through a web browser.

            Ever since high school, I was always scared of math subjects. Even after passing Math 27 and Math 28 in UPLB,
            I still got anxious when I hear anything that is related to them. But, everything changed when I took <strong>MATH 10 - Mathematics, Culture, and Society</strong>
            as one of my GE subjects. It became my favorite GE course because not only did it improve my math skills for computer science, it also taught me how to overcome
            math anxiety and how we can appreciate and use mathematics in our society.

<!-- FAVORITE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE SECTION -->

  <h2>Favorite Programming Language</h2>
  <p>
    When you enter the university as a computer science student, expect that you will learn a lot of programming languages. At the time being, I know 5 languages: Python, C, Javascript, Java, and R. Among the 5, my favorite
    is the <strong>R programming language</strong> for the reason that the syntax is relatively easier to understand and type.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love R becuase it is very close to the English language when compared to other languages
    like C and Java. It also allows users to create collections of things like arrays and vectors in a jiffy! You don't even have to worry about memory allocation or get confused with 0-indexing system of arrays. I'm not
    saying that this is the best programming language, but R provides you an easier way to analyze data by implementing abstract ideas and formula into code without having to think much about the syntax. It gives you the
    focus that you need in order to perform numeric and symbolic computations. To learn more about R, <a href="https://www.r-project.org/about.html" target="_blank">&nbsp;click here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that even though R is my favorite programming language, I am not saying that this is always my first choice for a project. Remember that it is okay to have a favorite programming language, but know that each language
    has its own strenghts and weaknesses, so choose your language accordingly.

    Life in <em>Elbi</em> can be really stressful which is why sometimes
    the best remedy is food trip! My favorite food is the famous Korean dish: <strong>Samgyeopsal</strong>!
    My college friends and I love going out for a night drive to hunt for samgyeopsal in the neighboring city, Calamba. We always
    look for restaurants that offer unlimited servings! The picture shown here is the last samgyeopsal meal that we had before the pandemic <i class="far fa-sad-cry"></i>

  <h2>Hobbies and Childhood Dream</h2>
  <p>
    It is very seldom that I get free time for myself because we really have a lot of schoolwork, but if do, I usually <strong>workout</strong>
    in the gym to burn some fats and be ready for summer. I also <strong>play basketball</strong> with my friends as a form of
    exercise and bonding. I also <strong>build robots</strong> and <strong>code</strong> them to do fun and interesting stuff. I guess my interest in robotics
    was developed when I joined the <em>Letran Robotics Team</em> and the <em>Philippine Robotics Team</em> back in high school.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I was a kid, my dream was to become a <strong>professional basketball player who can also hack systems</strong>. It was a weird dream, but I guess that's the reason why I
    love basketball so much and why I am in this degree program. Aside from shooting hoops with my childhood friends, we also pretended that we were hackers and
    developers. We used to play with our laptop toys and imagined that we were having a cyber showdown <i class="far fa-laugh-squint"></i>. Now, I am already an <em>isko</em>
    training in the field of computer science. I hope that after I complete this course, I will be at least a step closer to my dream.
