       <h2>Hi! I am Rafael Red Angelo M. Hizon.</h2>
       <p>
         Since I have three names, people call me differently. Some call me
         "Rafael" while others prefer "Angelo". However, most people
        especially my professors and classmates in the university... they love to call me <strong>Red</strong>,
        and that became my official college nickname ever since!</p>

            I am currently a sophomore student in the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. I am taking
          <strong>BS Computer Science</strong> because I really love to learn how to program in order to
          create beautiful apps and websites. In fact, this page is actually our laboratory exercise
          on our <a href="http://ics.uplb.edu.ph/courses/ugrad/cmsc/100" target="_blank">web programming course!</a>

            As a <em>komsay iskolar</em>, I have encountered a lot of punishing subjects that really
            forced my mind to think critically. But even though the courses were hard, I truly appreciate them
            for they have played a significant role in my development stage as a programmer.
             So far, my favorite computer science
            course is <strong>CMSC 100 - Web Programming</strong> because I am in love with the idea of bringing
            imagination to life through a web browser.

            Ever since high school, I was always scared of math subjects. Even after passing Math 27 and Math 28 in UPLB,
            I still got anxious when I hear anything that is related to it. But, everything changed when I took <strong>MATH 10 - Mathematics, Culture, and Society</strong>
            as one of my GE subjects. It became my favorite GE course because not only did it improve my math skills for computer science, it also taught me how to overcome
            math anxiety and how we can appreciate and use mathematics in our society.
